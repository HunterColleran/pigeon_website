## **What We Do**

We build tools that help people step away from screens and return their attention to the world around them.

Our first product, **Pigeon**, is a compact BLE smart pager that filters phone notifications and delivers only what matters. It attaches via MagSafe, features a monochrome amber display inspired by classic pagers, and is designed for quick glances — not endless scrolling. Hardware people want to hold and look at, built to move with them through daily life.

## **Why We Exist**

Modern technology is optimized to capture attention, not support presence. Our time is being monetized through endless feeds, notifications, and systems designed to keep us engaged — not aware.

Pigeon exists to rewrite our relationship with technology by building tools that respect attention, reduce digital noise, and help people return to the real world.

We're not building another screen to stare at. Pigeon is intentionally limited: no apps, no infinite scroll, no color display begging for attention. It shows you what you need to know, then gets out of the way. A return to what pagers did well — reliable, glanceable, calm communication.

We're building for people who want to put their phone in a drawer but can't afford to miss the important stuff: parents, on-call professionals, anyone trying to reclaim their attention.

## **Long-Term Vision**

Pigeon is the first step toward a healthier relationship with technology. We see a future where devices respect human attention rather than exploit it — where "smart" means knowing when to stay quiet, not just when to buzz.

Our roadmap extends beyond Pigeon to a family of focused, single-purpose devices that solve real problems without creating new ones. Hardware that earns a place in your life by making it better, not busier.

This is not nostalgia, but contrast: hardware people want to hold and look at, with materials and form that stand apart from the smooth, featureless slabs we carry today.

## **Design Philosophy**

Pigeon draws from both modern premium hardware and retrofuturistic technology of the late 20th century, devices designed with texture, clarity, and physical intent.

Inspired by dense urban environments and the pigeon itself, adaptive, observant, and comfortable in human-made spaces. Our designs reflect tools meant to move with people through daily life, prioritizing clarity, resilience, and function in real-world conditions.

Our visual identity takes cues from New York City subway signage and public transit systems: designed for legibility in motion, durable, and functional. Structure over decoration.
